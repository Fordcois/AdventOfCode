# Advent Of Code 

üéÑ[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of Christmas-themed programming challenges that revolve around rectifying the mishaps of a group of mischievous elves who wreak havoc across different datasets. Each problem is divided into two parts of increasing difficulty, rewarding a star for each successfully completed solution. These challenges span a variety of skill sets and approaches to data.
